# VIZATHON 2021
This repo contains the data used for Vizathon 2021, a competition organised by [Corono Virus Visualization team](https://understandcovid.org/). 

We used Public data provided [here](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data). 

We chose Public health Track (out of Public Heaalth, Social Justice and Economics Tracks), and completed Cahallenge 2.

We aim to Visualise the Global Covid cases and compare them with monthly (From Jan 2020- July 2021) Covid cases acroos the globe along with CardioVascular Diseases and Diabetes Patients to uncover relationship among them. We also Visualize how various countries have dealt with the pandemic during these months comparing the vaccinated population and stringency measures accroos major countries.

We took part in a team of 2 [me](https://github.com/RaghuMadhavTiwari) and [Archita Negi](https://github.com/ArchitaN10) and used Tableau Public (https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/).
